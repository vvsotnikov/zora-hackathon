Have you ever wanted an image search, like in Google, but for NFTs?
Now, with Zora's API and our outstanding data science expertise, this
has become possible.

We present you an app that uses neural networks to find NFTs using
text requests: picture of monkey? Done! 8-bit skeleton art? Here it
is. If there's an NFT, we'll find it for you. And that's just the tip
of the iceberg!

Do you want to check the authenticity of any NFT art? Our deep
learning algorithms will scan through the blockchain and find out
whether there are collections that look suspiciously similar to yours!

Finally, here's one more thing - our neural networks can also generate
new NFTs! Just send your wallet address, and we'll synthesize a
MetaNFT - all NFTs in your account, blended together by generative
networks. What a time to be alive. Please vote for us!
